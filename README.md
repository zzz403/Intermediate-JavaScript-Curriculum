# Intermediate-JavaScript-Curriculum

Welcome to the **Intermediate JavaScript Curriculum** repository!

This project-based course is designed to help students strengthen their JavaScript skills by building interactive applications and games. By the end, students will create a browser-based arcade game and understand core web programming concepts like DOM manipulation, events, data storage, and more.

## For Teachers

- **Slides & lesson outlines** are in `Lecture Notes/`
- Use the `teacher/` folders (e.g., `lec7`, `lec8`) for:
  - Live coding demos
  - Step-by-step teaching versions
- Use `dodge-final-demo.html` as an in-class demo or reference

---

## For Students

- Starter files are in `student/`
- Project instructions are in `assignment handout/`
- Run HTML files directly in a browser — no server setup needed

---

## Final Project: Dodge the Block Game

This course builds up to a full game across:

- **Lesson 7**: Movement, falling blocks, collision detection
- **Lesson 8**: Score system, Game Over screen, and leaderboard

By the end, students will:
- Create an interactive game using vanilla JS
- Use timers, events, DOM APIs, and storage
- Practice modular design via multi-view layout

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic HTML + CSS
- JavaScript fundamentals (functions, arrays, conditionals, events)

---

## Teaching Tips

- Use live coding with starter files
- Encourage creativity (themes, sound, difficulty levels)
- Celebrate final projects with a leaderboard showcase!
